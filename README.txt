This is a small example project to show use of AnimatedSprite.js


The only needed files to import into your project are:
AnimatedSprite.js
Math/Vec2D.js
Math/GeneralMath.js

Everything else is simply support for the demo.
Although AnimationDefinitions.js shows the proper format for defining animations.
The header at the top of AnimatedSprite.js has more usage information.
